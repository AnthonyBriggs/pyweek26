Just fixed a few weird bugs and reworked how the conveyor belt works. Now instead of having three positions, it maintains a linear distance and updates it constantly, so that the items move smoothly. A couple of bug fixes later and it seems to work pretty well. The annoying one was forgetting to return True when a conveyer accepts an item, so it was pushing the same item along the belt

Ok, so there are conveyor belts in the game now. They don't actually convey things, but you can pick them up and put them down with your alien. Spent a long time trying to tweak the UI to make it intuitive, but I'm still not 100% happy with it. Never mind, onwards, onwards - I'm sure it'll change a bit as the game goes on anyway.

There's also multiplayer, so if you have multiple joysticks, the aliens can each have a conveyor of their own.

And if anyone's testing this (I doubt it), at the moment there's a hack in the PygameZero joystick handlers to get around the numbering due to my Gamecube adapter. Let me know if you have trouble fixing it and I can help out :)

So, thinking about the industrial build things idea. Rough breakdown of early features (story backlog :) )
    - Aliens move around on screen, add/remove them when pushing start button
    - Parts on screen (ie. conveyors, machines), put into a grid.
    - Aliens can pick conveyors + machines up and move them around (will need an 'arms up' modification to kenney graphics?).
    - things (resources, parts, products) can go on the conveyor belts + will move up/down/left/right (might need conveyor up/down moving graphics?)
    - Aliens should be able to pick (resources, parts, products) up + put them back on the conveyors.
    - machines can take an input belt + create other things
    - source 'hoppers' for raw materials, feed in if the conveyor is empty
    - some simple recipes for things (products)
    - output 'trucks' to take away specific products

---------------------------------

The theme is flow, so the first step is to go look at kenney.nl (https://kenney.nl/assets?q=2d) and think about the sorts of games I can make, and how I'm going to do this whole thing.

Wishlist:
    . it should definitely be multiplayer
    . use the cute aliens from the platformer pack
    . use joysticks and have a couch game (but still need a single player mode)

Thoughts on the theme/graphics:
    . Should we use just one or two map packs? or collate a "custom" image set?
    . Platformer deluxe doesn't really fit the 'flow' theme (pipes, rivers, etc.) unless I do weird stuff with it?
    . Some sort of pipes? Aliens building a pipe network for some reason? Water or sewage management? (https://kenney.nl/assets/puzzle-pack-2)
    . Or perhaps holding back a tide or river to save a town from flooding? (https://kenney.nl/assets/map-pack)
        - rain -> river flow, build dams, plant/log trees, build sandbag walls, dig trenches, operate pumps, move water downhill or soak it into the ground.
    . Population or animal management?
        - Fences, food, crazy goat AI
        - try to get animals into the right place without having your roses or crops eaten
        - paths, different animal types don't mix (chickens + pigs)
        - animals can break fences if they're left for too long near food
    . Perhaps a permaculture simulation game? :o
        - more a simulation: cut down trees, plant different ones, encourage animals
        - manage erosion, water, sun, wind
        - relationships between the animals + plants, spreading seeds (poop!), eating certain types
        - fencing + management while the system stabilises
        - need to feed yourself, too.
    . Platformer industrial pack (https://kenney.nl/assets/platformer-pack-industrial) could work (not included in platformer complete pack?)
        - manage a production line, build conveyor belts, pick things up, run around with them
        - machines which assemble parts to make 'stuff'
            - ingots (copper, iron, carbon?, aluminium, biological?, glass)
                -> plates, wires, cogs
                -> widgets (boxes? larger parts, anyway)
                -> TVs, chainsaws, toys, robots (generic items pack: https://kenney.nl/assets/generic-items)
        - different types of flow
            - parts, electrical, hydraulic
            - multiple lines of production
            - different tools for each, which you have to pick up and put down :)
        - limited parts (belts, pipes, wires, machines) to make it happen
        - new parts arrive all the time (can order some?)
        - requests for new things to make,
        - refactoring production lines on the fly
        - maybe stuff randomly breaks and backs up and you have to fix it?
        - timed, everyone running around frantically trying to make it all hang together
        - bathroom breaks - every alien has a little yellow bar next to them which builds up over time. Maybe only one bathroom, too :D
        - A manual (which you have to go run to) which will bring up lists of recipes
        - Maybe you need to build the machines, too?


Workflow:
    . 3 hour 'crunches' a'la agile sprints
    . 2-3 crunches per day 
        - maybe 4 if a crunch finishes early
        - 2 if I have something on in the evening
    . try and have an extra feature + working game at the end of each crunch
    . Python-only version for most of it, but build an .exe at key points/milestones
    . recruit play testers
        - family :)
        - might be hard for a couch co-op?
    . need to leave time for polish + playtesting (maybe? or just go full goat simulator)
