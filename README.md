Alien Toy Factory

A game built in a week using Python, PyGame Zero, Mu and Kenney.nl graphics.

Windows executable and source available from:

https://pyweek.org/e/kenney_fanclub/
https://github.com/AnthonyBriggs/pyweek26


Instructions:

 1. Run the executable if you're on Windows, or install Python and Pygame and run python alien_toy_factory.py 
 2. If you have a controller with at least one axis and a couple of buttons (ie. something like an Xbox or Playstation controller), and its recognised by Pygame, that's the most fun way to play. Up to four players should be able to play. 
 3. Keyboard controls are WASD+space/LAlt for player 1, and arrow keys+RShift/Return for player 2.
 4. Hit space/RShift to pick something up and put it down
 5. For conveyors you can hold space/RShift and push in a direction to set which way it goes. 
 6. Build a conveyor and machine system to convert the raw materials on the left side into products for the loading docks on the right side. 
 7. There's a simple help system at the top, which shows recipes for all of the machines unlocked so far. 

Caveats/known issues: 

 - cross over conveyors are not the most intuitive things in the world. I didn't have time to come up with a way to set the direction of both conveyors, so the second is just one clockwise from the first.
 - I haven't added sound, and probably won't at this stage. It's been a pretty big effort to get this far :D-day
 - I haven't thoroughly tested all of the levels, so some of them might be actually impossible to do ;)
 - There probably should be an intro screen for each level, but again, time's running out.

Debug keys:

 - F1 will show the first machine help page
 - F3 will reduce the product requirements for the level by one
 - F4 will increase the product requirements (if you're having too much fun to stop, I guess...)
 - F5 will immediately finish the level
 - the number keys along the top (1-8) will switch levels at will

Have fun playing, and let me know if you run into problems or encounter any show stopping bugs.
